## üéØ **WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU (CLIENT)**

### **1. YOUR SOLANA WALLET FOR PAYMENT SYSTEM**

**Purpose**: To receive payments from users and automatically upgrade their access based on package purchases.

**Required**:
- **Your Solana wallet address** (Phantom, Solflare, or any Solana wallet)
- **Wallet private key** (for transaction monitoring)

**How It Will Work**:
```
User buys package ‚Üí Sends SOL to your wallet ‚Üí Bot detects payment ‚Üí Upgrades user access
```

### **2. PACKAGE PRICING & DURATION SYSTEM**

**Current Logic** (as per your requirements):
- **0.5 SOL** = **7 hours** of bot access
- **3% fee** on each transaction/trade made by bot
- **Automatic upgrade** when payment is received

**What We Need You to Confirm**:
1. **Your wallet address** for receiving payments
2. **Package durations**:
   - Basic: 0.5 SOL = 7 hours?
   - Pro: 1 SOL = 14 hours?
   - Premium: 2 SOL = 28 hours?
   - Enterprise: 5 SOL = 70 hours?

3. **Transaction fee percentage**: 3% on each trade?

## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Payment Detection System**
1. **Monitor your wallet** for incoming SOL payments
2. **Detect payment amount** and sender address
3. **Match payment to package** (0.5 SOL = 7 hours, etc.)
4. **Automatically upgrade user** based on sender address

### **Phase 2: User Wallet Connection**
1. **Users connect their wallets** (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
2. **Bot trades from user's wallet** (not your wallet)
3. **3% fee deducted** from each trade
4. **Fee sent to your wallet** automatically

### **Phase 3: Time-Based Access**
1. **Track user's remaining time** based on package
2. **Auto-disable bot** when time expires
3. **Send notification** to user before expiry
4. **Allow re-purchase** to extend access
